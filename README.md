# __Extreme Events and Disasters in India: Analyzing Trends and Government Response__

### __Overview__
India is facing a growing crisis of natural disasters, with both their frequency and intensity increasing significantly in recent decades. As climate change accelerates, the country’s exposure to extreme weather events—cyclones, floods, heatwaves, and more—has risen sharply. This crisis places immense strain on resources, including infrastructure, public health, and government budgets. This report analyzes trends in natural disasters from __1990__ to __2024__, highlighting their evolving nature, geographical shifts, and government response. The findings emphasize the urgent need for data-driven disaster management strategies to improve preparedness and resilience.

This report analyzes government data to uncover key trends in India’s disaster landscape. It provides insights into:
- The increasing frequency and shifting geography of disasters
- The rise of new climate-driven threats (heatwaves, lightning, and cold waves)
- Disaster relief funding trends and gaps

### __Key Findings__
- _Surging Natural Disasters:_ The number of disasters in India has risen from 4 in the 1990s to 63 in 2020-2023, with new hotspots emerging in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana.
- _Changing Disaster Patterns:_ Cyclonic storms increased from 2 (2010-2019) to 17 (2020-2024), heatwaves became a major concern, and lightning strikes surged from 2 to 25 in the same period.
- _Funding Gaps in Disaster Management:_ Despite a rise in government spending, funding allocation remains inconsistent—newly affected states like Jharkhand receive less despite rising risks.
